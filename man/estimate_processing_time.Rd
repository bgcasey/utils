\usage{
estimate_processing_time(n_features, nsub, end_time, start_time)

estimate_processing_time(n_features, nsub, end_time, start_time)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_features}{Numeric. The total number of features in the
dataset.}

\item{nsub}{Numeric. The number of features actually processed in
the partial subset.}

\item{end_time}{POSIXct. The time the subset processing ended.}

\item{start_time}{POSIXct. The time the subset processing started.}
}
\value{
Character string. A human-readable duration representing
the estimated total processing time for all features.

Character string. A human-readable duration representing
the estimated total processing time for all features.
}
\description{
Calculates an estimated total processing time for a complete
dataset based on the time taken to process a subset of its
features. The result is returned as a human-readable string
indicating days, hours, minutes, and remaining seconds.
