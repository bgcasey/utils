\title{Select a single response column}
\usage{
select_one_response(gbm_data, chosen_response, response_vars, reorder = TRUE)

select_one_response(gbm_data, chosen_response, response_vars, reorder = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gbm_data}{data.frame. The full dataset containing responses
and predictors.}

\item{chosen_response}{character. The name of the response variable
you want to keep.}

\item{response_vars}{character vector. A list of all possible
response variables.}

\item{reorder}{logical. If TRUE, the chosen response column is moved
to the front of the new data frame. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A data frame that includes only the chosen response column
(plus all columns that were not in \code{response_vars}).

A data frame that includes only the chosen response column
(plus all columns that were not in \code{response_vars}).
}
\description{
This function subsets a dataframe so it keeps only one chosen response
variable plus all other columns that are \emph{not} in the set of response
variables.

This function subsets a dataframe so it keeps only one chosen response
variable plus all other columns that are \emph{not} in the set of response
variables.

\examples{
# Suppose 'response_vars' contains c("sonchus_arvensis", "cirsium_arvense", ...)
# and 'gbm_data' is your data frame with those columns plus predictors.

# Keep only "cirsium_arvense" as the response:
new_data <- select_one_response(
    gbm_data        = gbm_data,
    chosen_response = "cirsium_arvense",
    response_vars   = response_vars,
    reorder         = TRUE
)

# Check the first few columns:
head(new_data)
